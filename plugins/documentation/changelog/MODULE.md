# Module changelog

A custom plugin for changelog plugin which uses
[JetBrains Changelog plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-changelog-plugin) under the hood.

### Download from MavenCentral

```kotlin
// buildSrc/build.gradle.kts

dependencies {
    implementation("com.javiersc.gradle-plugins:changelog:$version")
}
```

### Apply

In the root `build.gradle.kts`

```kotlin
plugins {
    `javiersc-changelog`
}
```

### Usage

Completely configured, check the original plugin for more info.

```shell
./gradlew mergeChangelog
```

This task has only effect when the project version is final, and it will merge the previous
beta/alpha/rc versions into one when it is invoked. The date of the merged version will be the date
when the task is executed.

The usual workflow when it is desired to merge all non-final versions into one when the final
version is being released is to patch the changelog and then merge it:

```shell
./gradlew patchChangelog mergeChangelog
```

- Add items via CLI

It allows adding easily a new item to the any section block:

```shell
./gradlew addChangelogItem --added "some new item"
```

It supports add all dependencies from a PR created by Renovate if the body content is passed as
argument:

```shell
./gradlew addChangelogItem --renovate "[PR BODY]"
```
